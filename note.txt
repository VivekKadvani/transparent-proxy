for verification 
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia contract adddress


first using deploy.js 
we can deploy our main contract with having proxy pattern 

using deployProxy.js
we can change logic of our contract i mean we can update our contract with new implementation.
make sure address must need to change. 


How to implement ?
-first add contract code
-than change name in deploy.js script 
-than run deploy script and verify it using it's contract address
-as of now our transperent proxy is created.
when we need to upgrade our contract:
-add code to contract foler
-change name in deployProxy.js 
-run deployProxy.js 
-again run verify command with same address
-and it will be updataed 

Node : etherscan not support proxy pattern
